ADVICE
- DAQ randomly acting weird, seems completely undocumented?
    - timeout for stop command is running out

- cameras also sometimes acting weird with no warning?
    - breaking because they're out of space - shouldn't ever happen


PREFERENCES
- new folder per trial or per protocol?
    - does this change for passive vs active acquisition

- un-load protocol once it's finished or re-load at t=0?
- desired behaviour for single stim? should you be able to do it indefinitely? unload after one?
- what's the data MEANT to look like when it comes out? - check



***TAKEAWAYS***
don't preload the DAQ until you press start, just visualise. 
Want to be able to click through the stimulus file FAST, don't mind a bit of latency after you press start


Single stim - runs just the one that's visible - 
save in exactly the same format, same name as the protocol but just one output in it, 
maybe a flag that it's a single trial in the folder name

QST outputs:
need to turn on the little black box

DAQ investigate self-imposed timeout
