s (session)
    enabledDevices

g (general)
    nProtRuns (int)
    randomise (int)
    dPause    (int, sec)
    trials    (nx1 cell array of trials - t struct)
        can also define tPre tPost and nTrialRuns but they get applied to t directly

t (trial info)
    root (StimBlock)
    tPre (int, ms)
    tPost (int, ms)
    nTrialRuns (int)
    comment (string)

StimBlock (node > handle)
attributes
    parent (StimBlock)
    children (cell array of StimBlocks)
    relationship (char, single/oddball/simultaneous/sequential)
    repDel (int, ms)
    startDel (int, ms)
    nStimRuns (int)
    stimParams (struct, see stimParams)
methods
    generateStim (if isstim, generate, else call child.generate for each child and then arrange)
    getChildren
    generateDAQTrial (returns table of componentProtocolID | channelID (stimID) | stimTrain)
    generateHardwareTrial (returns struct of ProtocolID: trialInformation)
    
stimParams
    identifier (name)
    targetDevices
    type
    isAcquisitionTrigger (bool, if true start at tPre)

****struct of ProtocolID: trialInformation****
realistically all we need at the moment.
trialInformation should all include stimParams fields plus individual ones.
