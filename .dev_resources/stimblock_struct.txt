s (session)
    enabledDevices

g (general)
    nProtRuns (int)
    rand      (int)
    dPause    (int, sec)
        can also define tPre tPost and nTrialRuns but they get applied to t directly

t (trial info)
    tPre (int, ms)
    tPost (int, ms)
    nTrialRuns (int)
    comment (string)

s (stimuli)
    1 x n cell array where each entry is a 1 x m cell array.
        n is the number of trials in the protocol
        m is the number of StimulusBlocks in each trial

StimBlock (node)
attributes
    parent (int, index of location of parent in the s array)
    children (vector where each entry is the index of its children in the s array)
    relationship (char, single/oddball/simultaneous/sequential)
    repDel (int, ms)
    startDel (int, ms)
    nStimRuns (int)
    stimParams (struct, see stimParams)
methods
    generateStim (if isstim, generate, else call child.generate for each child and then arrange)
    getChildren
    generateDAQTrial (returns table of componentProtocolID | channelID (stimID) | stimTrain)
    generateHardwareTrial (returns struct of ProtocolID: trialInformation)
Special Considerations
    root node children is a struct with fields tPreStims and tPostStims.
    
stimParams
    identifier (name)
    targetDevices
    type
    isAcquisitionTrigger (bool, if true start at tPre)

****struct of ProtocolID: trialInformation****
realistically all we need at the moment.
trialInformation should all include stimParams fields plus individual ones.
